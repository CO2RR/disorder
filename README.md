## What is ***disorder*** ?
- ***disorder*** is an open source software designed for generating irreducible site-occupancy configurations (i.e., symmetrically inequivalent disordered structures), which can be used for disordered doping, including substitution doping and vacancy doping.

## Features
- Build supercell form arbitrary input cell with any supercell expansion matrix.
- Search space group operations of the supercell and identify its point group symbol.
- Construct the equivalent atomic matrix of the atomic positions of the doping site.
- Generate irreducible configurations for any number of atomic types with arbitrary stoichiometry.
- Count the degeneracy (the number of equivalent configurations) of each irreducible configuration.
- Output the the crystal structure file of each irreducible configuration.
